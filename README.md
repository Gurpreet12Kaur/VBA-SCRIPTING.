# VBA-SCRIPTING.
MODULE 2 Challenge
I was asked to  generate a script that loops over all the stocks for a year:
The symbol for the ticker,
Annual variation between the price at the start of a given year and the price at the conclusion of that year.
The difference in value is expressed as a percentage between the price at the start and the price at the conclusion of a given year.
The stock's overall stock volume.

To complete the challenge I went through our class recording and watch the youtube videos that will help me improve my skills using VBA scripting. 

Summarise what I did (talk about loops), including screenshots of results and vba
what I was asked to do.
